I participated in a project to test an e-commerce site. I tested the functionality and features.

I gathered business requirements from the project manager, which included user stories, acceptance criteria, functionalities, and expectations for the e-commerce site.


**2. End-to-end manual testing in Postman using REST API.**

1. Use the Student Management System
2. Add a POST Request: Add Student, Kandies A Hall, to the system.
3. Make GET Request: To retrieve data of students I added in the  prior step.
4. Make a PUT Request: Update Kandies A Hall to Kandies A Evon in the system.
5. Again Make a GET Request: To validate whether PUT worked correctly or did not work correctly.
6. Make a DELETE Request: To Delete the studentâ€™s data.
7. Again make one last GET Request: To validate whether DELETE worked correctly or did not work correctly.
